## Features 

### Add tasks
Tachikoma can add three types of tasks with their description to your task list:
* `Todo`: a general type of task without an associated date
* `Deadline`: tasks with duedates
* `Event`: tasks with dates specifying when the events take place.

### List all tasks

Tachikoma can show your task list, which contains the tasks you have added before.

### Mark as done

Tachikoma can mark a task as done, after which the task will be displayed with a checkmark in front of its description.

### Delete tasks

Tachikoma can delete a task from the task list if you feel that it is no longer necessary to have it on the list.

### Undo previous commands

In case you accidentally delete an important task, Tachikoma get you covered! You can use undo command to: 

* recover tasks that you have accidentally deleted
* uncheck the task that you have just marked as done
* remove the newly added task if you realized that the information of it is incorrect.
