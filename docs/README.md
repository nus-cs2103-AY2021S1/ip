## Features 

### Add tasks
Duke supports the creation of three different types of tasks: [`todo`](#todo---adding-a-todo), [`deadline`](#deadline---adding-a-deadline) and [`event`](#event---adding-a-event). `todo` allows the user to give a description to the task while `deadline` and `event` allows the user to specify a date in which the task must be completed by or at respectively.

### List tasks
Duke is able to [`list`](#list---listing-all-tasks) the tasks the user has added. Duke displays the type of the task, description of the task and status of the task.

### Mark task as done
Duke allows the user to mark a task as [`done`](#done---marking-a-task-as-done) once the user has completed the task.

### Delete tasks
Duke is able to [`delete`](#delete---deleting-a-task) tasks that has already been added.


### Find tasks
Duke can [`find`](#find---finding-a-task) tasks that include a certain string in its description and list them for easy access.

### Undo last command
Duke can [`undo`](#undo---undoing-previous-command) the last command that made a change to the task list.
