# User Guide

Duke is a **desktop app for tracking down todos, deadlines and events for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Duke can get your tasks management done faster than traditional GUI apps.

</strong>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `todo TASK`, `TASK` is a parameter which can be used as `todo wash car`.

* Spacing before and after the command and input will automatically be ignored.<br>
 e.g. the command `[some spacing] todo [some spacing] CS2103T project [some spacing]` will be interpreted as `todo CS2103T project`.
