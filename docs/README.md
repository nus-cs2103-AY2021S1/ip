# PikaDuke User Guide
A CS2103 Project to create a simple bot for to-do tasking. 
 
The attitude of which I have adopted for this module as well as for the
graphics are inspired by my all time favorite game:

segment his tasks into.

### 2. Storage and Retrieval of Tasks  <a name="storage"></a>
PikaDuke will smartly retrieve an existing set of task if there is an existing 
file in your local computer. Upon launching of PikaDuke, it will parse through the 
text file and create the task list to be loaded into PikaDuke.

If there are no files located by PikaDuke, PikaDuke will automatically create a 
text file named `duke.txt`  in the same directory as the source file. All writing and loading functions
will be directed to this `duke.txt`.

The default file path set for this is as follows:

    private final String defaultPath = "./duke.txt";
The code is located in`Storage.java`. If you would like to change the directory to another location
or change the filename, you can edit so via the above shown code in `Storage.java`.

### 3. Listing  <a name="listing"></a>

- **Listing** - `list`

Displays all the existing task list in PikaDuke.

**Example of usage:** 

    list

**Expected outcome:**

    Retrieving your list, patient ah!
        1. [T][X] eat genki sushi
        2. [E][X] eat shabusai (at: 14 Nov 2020, 12:00PM)
        3. [D][X] eat steak (by: 14 Nov 2020, 11:00AM)

### 4. Marking Completion  <a name="marking"></a>
- **Marking** - `done <index of task>`

Marks the completion, indicated by a `X` or `✓`. Completed tasks will display `[✓]`.
The index of the task corresponds to the number of which it is listed, you can simply run `list`
to check the index of the task.

**Example of usage:** 

    done 1

**Expected outcome:**

    Swee la, task done liao:
        [T][✓] eat genki sushi

---

### 5. Deletion of Task  <a name="delete"></a>
- **Deleting** - `delete <index of task>`

Deletes a task that is existing on the list.
The index of the task corresponds to the number of which it is listed, you can simply run `list`
to check the index of the task. You can run the command `list` again to see that the task is no longer
on the list.

**Example of usage:** 

    delete 1

**Expected outcome:**

    Delete liao boss:
    Remaining Tasks: 2

### 6. Searching  <a name="searching"></a>
- **Searching** - `find <key word(s)>`

Finds the tasks that contains the <key word(s)> and lists only the relevant task(s).
Note that this will not delete the tasks not relevant with the search word.

**Example of usage:**

### 7. Sorting of Tasks  <a name="sorting"></a>
- **Sorting** - `sort`

This features helps to sort the task existing in the list. The `sort` sorts the
task list according to the date and time input. For the `todo` type tasks, without the
time and date input, will be pushed to the bottom of the list.

**Example of usage:** 

    user input: 
        list
    
    output:   
        Retrieving your list, patient ah!
