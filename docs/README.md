## Additional Help
Q: Why am I unable to run the JAR file?  
A: Please ensure that your laptop supports at least Java 11.  
  
Q: What if I am changing my laptop?  
A: Don't worry! At the current directory you are at right now, you should see a data folder created for you. 
Simply copy the folder into your new laptop, and run the JAR file in the same directory, and Focus will 
retrieve all the data for you!
