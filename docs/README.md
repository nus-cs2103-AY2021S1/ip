## How to Begin

1. Ensure Java 11 has been downloaded and installed on your computer.
2. Download the latest version of IrohBot.jar [here](https://github.com/EthanTheGoondu/ip/releases/download/A-Release/IrohBot.jar)
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your IrohBot.

   - `todo Example` : Adds a task of type Todo with description "Example".
   - `delete 2`: Deletes the second Task in your task list.
   - `bye` : Exits the app.



## Command format:

* Words in upper case are parameters to be supplied by the user. For instance,  in `todo TODO_NAME`, TODO_NAME is the parameter in this command.
* For the field known as DATE_AND_TIME, the format of writing said date and time is: `DD-mm-YY HHMM` where D represents the day, m represents the month, Y represents the year, H represents the hour and M represents the minute.
