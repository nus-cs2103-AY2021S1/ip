# Mushy User Guide

Mushy is a **Personal Assistant Chatbot for keeping track 
of tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** 
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User 
Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Mushy can get your 
tasks management done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Features
> ℹ️  **Notes about the command format:**
> - Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.  
> e.g. in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `todo meet friend`.  
>
> - Items in square brackets are optional.  
> e.g. `deadline DESCRIPTION /by DATE [TIME]` can be used as `deadline book report /by 15/9/2020` or as `deadline book report /by 15/9/2020 2359`  
>
> - Items with `...` after them can be used one or multiple times.  
> e.g. `find KEYWORD...` can be used as `find read` or `find read book`.  
>
> - Order of parameters must be fixed.  
> e.g. if the command specifies `event DESCRIPTION /at PERIOD`, `event /at PERIOD DESCRIPTION` is **not** acceptable.
