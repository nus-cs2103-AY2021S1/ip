# User Guide

Tebby is a chatbot app for managing tasks via either a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or Command Line Interface (CLI). Both interfaces are
generally the same except GUI has a more user-friendly way of choosing dates from a dropdown calendar when creating tasks. Interacting with
a chatbot with a fun personality can help make task management more appealing, hence improving productivity.

## Using the GUI Calendar

![sample calendar](samplecalendar.png)

The calendar dropdown button can be found on the right next to the text field. Upon selection of a date,
the date will be appended to the text field. This eases user from typing entire dates, and also aids users
in planning of dates with the visuals of a calendar.
