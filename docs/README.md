# User Guide
Viscount is a **desktop app for managing tasks, optimised for use via a Command Line Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are someone who can type fast, Viscount can help you track your tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.

1. Download the jar file from the project website.

## Features 
1. Three types of tasks:
    1. Todos
    1. Deadlines
    1. Events
1. Add, mark as done, and delete tasks
1. List tasks, filterable by:
    1. task type
    1. keyword search
    1. date search
1. Mass operations
    1. mark all tasks as done

### `add` - Adding a task
Adds a task into the list.

There are three types of tasks: `Todo`, `Deadline` and `Event`.

Format:
```
// add a todo
add todo DESCRIPTION

// add a deadline
add deadline DESCRIPTION /by DATE_DUE

// add an event
add event DESCRIPTION /at DATE_OF_EVENT
```

Example usage:
```
add todo read book
add deadline return book /by 28-09-2020
add event go to library /at 28-09-2020 1000
```


Expected outcome:
```
Very well. I've added this todo:
[T][✘] read book
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.

Very well. I've added this deadline:
[D][✘] return book (by: Sep 28 2020 00:00)
Now you have 2 tasks in the list.

Very well. I've added this event:
[E][✘] go to library (at: Sep 28 2020 10:00)
Now you have 3 tasks in the list.
```

### `list` - Listing tasks
Shows a list of all tasks.
Filter the list by:
- task type 
- keyword search with `/find`
- date search with `/on`

Format:
```
list [TASK_TYPE] [/on DATE_FILTER] [/find KEYWORD]
```

Example usage:
```

list deadline /on 28-09-2020 /find book
OR
list deadline /find book /on 28-09-2020
// order of the two parameters does not matter
```
