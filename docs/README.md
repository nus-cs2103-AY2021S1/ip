##Key Features

####Adding and deleting a task 

There are quite a couple ways to add a task such as:**`todo`** **`deadline`** **`event`**
![img](./images/feature_add.png)

To add a todo task:
```
todo DESCRIPTION
e.g. todo homework for CS2100
```

To add a deadline task:
```
deadline DESCRIPTION /by DATETIME
e.g. deadline homework for CS2100 /by 9/9/2020 2359
```

To add a event task:
```
event DESCRIPTION /at DATETIME
e.g. event party /at 1/1/2021 0000
```
Do take note that `DESCRIPTION` can be a sentence with spaces between words, and there must be a 
whitespace before and after `/at` or `/by`. Also, `DATETIME` must be in the form of `dd/MM/yyyy hhmm`
, i.e. `1/1/2020 1800`. The given date must be in the future or the date will be invalid.



If you want to delete a certain task, you can use the command  **`delete`**

```
delete TASKINDEX
e.g. delete 1
```

If you want to delete all the tasks stored, use **`clearall`**
```
clearall
```

####Find a task

Find a task by using command such as **`find`** and **`date`**

Command `find` is designed to find tasks by matching the description of the tasks while command `date` focus
on finding tasks by their date and time.

Find tasks with certain keyword:
```
find KEYWORD
e.g. find homework
```
![img](./images/feature_date.png)

```
date DATE
e.g. date 10/12/2020
```

####Mark as done

![img](./images/feature_done.png)

To mark task as done:
```
done TASKINDEX
```
Note that you might want to check the correct index of the task before 
marking a task as done, as there isn't a way to mark a task as undone yet.
