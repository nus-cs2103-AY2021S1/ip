# User Guide

## Features 

### Add tasks
Use Duke to add tasks to keep track of. Duke supports adding Todos, Deadlines and Events.

- *Todos* are tasks to indicate activities that need to be completed
- *Deadlines* are tasks to indicate activities and the deadline they need to be completed by
- *Events* are tasks to indicate activities and the time they (should) occur

### View your tasks
You can ask Duke to display your current tasks, including whether they are completed
 or not, and if they have a timing (deadline/ event time) specified. 

### Mark tasks
You can ask Duke to mark tasks in the list as done after you have completed them!

### Delete tasks
You can ask Duke to delete tasks that are no longer valid, or those that you don't want to keep track of anymore.

### Search tasks
You can ask Duke to search through the list and find tasks that contain your search input.
Duke will then display these tasks as a list.

### Conduct operations on multiple tasks
Duke allows you to conduct some operations, like delete, on multiple tasks
at the same time! Simply indicate the operation and the search key to find the tasks
to perform the operation on.
