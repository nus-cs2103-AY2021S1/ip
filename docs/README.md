### **User Guide Command Formatting :**  

-    `UPPER_CASE` values used in command formatting examples indicates the unique parameters the user needs to provide.   

> For example,  in  `done INDEX`,  `INDEX`  here refers to the index of the task that the user wants to mark as complete and hence can take on a varying value (1 - size of list).

- Items in square brackets are optional.  

> For instance,  `deadline DESCRIPTION /by DATE [TIME]`  can be used as  `deadline
> submit report /by 03.12.20 1800`  or as  `deadline submit report /by
> 03.12.20`.

## 1. Adding a task 

### `Todo`

Calling the **todo** command adds a todo task to the task list. A **todo** task contains only requires a description and will not accept an accompanying date or time. To add tasks with date and time, refer to the [deadline](https://avalionnet.github.io/Project-Duke/#Deadline) or [event](https://avalionnet.github.io/Project-Duke/#Event) commands.

Format: `todo DESCRIPTION`

> Examples:
> 
> -   `todo Celebrate Teacher's Day`
> -   `todo Complete GEQ1000 Quiz`
>

### `Event`

Calling the **event** command adds an event task to the task list. An **event** task contains a description, date and time parameter to indicate the event's date and time.

Format: `event DESCRIPTION /at DATE TIME`

**Examples:**

-   `event CS2101 OP1 /at 15.09.20 1000`
-   `event Hackathon Finale /at 19.09.20 0900` 

![Event Image of Duke Chatbot](https://avalionnet.github.io/Project-Duke/Event.png)

 >**Important Note :** 
> - The delimiter **/at must be added** between the `DESCRIPTION` and `DATE` of the event.
> - The date specified must be set in the future and must follow the format **dd.mm.yy**
> Note that a single digit day or month must also be accompanied by a 0 in front.
 (i.e. 03.02.21 to denote 3rd Feburary 2021)
> - Any time specified must be in the **HHmm** format. 
 (i.e. 2100 to denote 9 p.m)
 >- Please ensure that there is a space between all key parameters for accurate parsing by Duke.


### `Deadline`

Calling the **deadline** command adds a deadline task to the task list. A **deadline** task contains a description, date and time parameter to indicate the event's date and time.

Format: `deadline DESCRIPTION /by DATE TIME`

**Examples:**

-   `deadline CS2100 lab 2 /by 20.09.20 1000`
-   `deadline Art competition submission /by 30.10.20 2100` 

![Deadline Image of Duke Chatbot](https://avalionnet.github.io/Project-Duke/Deadline.png)

 >**Important Note :** 
> - The delimiter **/by must be added** between the `DESCRIPTION` and `DATE` of the event.
> - The date specified must be set in the future and must follow the format **dd.mm.yy**
> Note that a single digit day or month must also be accompanied by a 0 in front.
 (i.e. 03.02.21 to denote 3rd Feburary 2021)
> - Any time specified must be in the **HHmm** format.

### b. View all tasks on a particular date : `view`

Finds tasks that match the specified date. Only works with tasks that support date and time values like `deadline` or `event` tasks.

Format:  `view DATE`

**Examples:**  For illustration purposes, let us assume that your current task list contains the following tasks:
 1. todo buy dinner 
 2. event attend housewarming party /at 29.10.20  1000
 3. deadline submit CS2103T user guide /by 18.09.20 2359
 4. event halo meetup /at 29.10.20 0900
-   `view 29.10.20`  returns  tasks **2 and 4**
-   `view 18.09.20`  returns  task **3**
-    task 1 will never be returned 

![Image of View Command](https://avalionnet.github.io/Project-Duke/View.png)


> **Note:** 
> - The date specified must be set in the future and must follow the format **dd.mm.yy**
> Note that a single digit day or month must also be accompanied by a 0 in front.
 (i.e. 03.02.21 to denote 3rd Feburary 2021)
> -   The view command only supports a search by the input date. Searching by time is not yet supported.
> -   Please do not specify more than 1 date

### c. Find a task by name : `find`

Find tasks in the task list with descriptions that match or contains the given keyword(s).

Format:  `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

**Examples:** For illustration purposes, let us assume that your current task list contains the following tasks:  1) todo return Henry his iPhone cable   2) todo treat Henry to lunch  3) deadline pass Henry the completed source code /by 20.10.22
-   `find Henry`  returns  tasks **1 , 2 and 3**
-   `find iPhone cable`  returns task 1
-   `find dinner` returns no task 

![Image of Find Command](https://avalionnet.github.io/Project-Duke/List.png)

> **Note:**
> -   The search only works on task descriptions.
> -   The search is case-sensitive. e.g  `Henry`  will match  `Henry` and not `henry`
> -   The order of the keywords matters. e.g.  `iPhone cable`  will not match  `cable iPhone`
> -   Partial words will also be matched e.g.  `iP`  will match  `iPhone`
> -   Only tasks matching all keywords specified will be returned  e.g.  `treat Henry`  will not match with  `treat Peter`,   `treat ***` or `*** Henry` where *** refers to an arbitrary value.


## 3. Marking a completed task : `done`

Mark a task as complete or done. This adds a tick symbol beside the targeted task.

Format:  **`done`**`TASK_INDEX`

-   Marks the task at the specified  `TASK_INDEX` as done.
-   First, use the `list` command to find the index of the task you want to mark as done. 
-   The `TASK_INDEX` here refers to the number shown beside the accompanying task in the task list after displaying it with the`list` command.
-   Please use a  **positive integer**  (eg. 1, 2, 3 …) for the index value to successfully mark a task as done.

> **Note:**
>  The task index must reference an existing task in the task list.
