# Awesome-O: User Guide

This is a relatively small greenfield project created for CS2103T Software Engineering.

It is simply a chat-bot that the user can interact with via the command-line to track tasks.

Types of tasks currently supported:
- Todos: tasks with no specific date/time
- Events: tasks with a set date/time of occurrence
- Deadlines: tasks with a set date date/time completion 

I've decided to customize it with the theme of one of my favourite shows: South Park :)
