Viscount is a **desktop app for managing tasks, optimised for use via a Command Line Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are someone who can type fast, Viscount can help you track your tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick Start for Users
1. Ensure you have Java 11 or later installed.
1. Download the jar file from the project website.
1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for the application.
1. Double-click the file to start the app. A GUI should appear, with the field bar to input commands.

Check out the [user guide](https://sc-arecrow.github.io/viscount/) to get started!

## Setting up in Intellij for Developers

1. Set up the correct JDK version, as follows:
   1. Click `Configure` > `Structure for New Projects` and then `Project Settings` > `Project` > `Project SDK`
   1. If JDK 11 is listed in the drop down, select it. If it is not, click `New...` and select the directory where you installed JDK 11
   1. Click `OK`
1. Import the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open or Import`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`
