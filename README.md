Welcome to IncrediBot, a task manager app which manages your todos, events and deadlines!

## About IncrediBot

This application was written for CS2103T Software Engineering as part of its Individual Project. In this project, we
are expected to learn more about SE principles and practices and apply them on a medium-sized Team Project.

## Features

In IncrediBot, three kinds of tasks can be created:

### 1. Todo

The simplest task in the whole app! Simply input a description and this task will be added to the bot.

### 2. Event

Events are used for scheduling purposes, allowing you to tag a specific time frame to a task. 
Time frames used can be flexible as you want it too! e.g. event eat /at Tampines

### 3. Deadline

Last but not least, we have deadlines, tasks with fixed due dates. Use it to track your all your assignment and
work deadlines!
 
## To assist you with managing your tasks are:

### Other Commands
 - `list` - Displays the list of tasks
 - `sort` - Sorts the tasks according to completion status and type
 - `done` - Completes a task
 - `delete` - Deletes a task
 - `find` - Finds all tasks which matches the query word

### Side features
 - Fully responsive UI which supports full-screen usage
 - Prompts displayed whenever you input a wrong command
 - Prevents addition of duplicate tasks
 - Accepts case-insensitive commands *e.g.* DeadLine
 - Compatible with Windows, MacOS and Linux
