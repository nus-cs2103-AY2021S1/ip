1. Set up the correct JDK version, as follows:
   1. Click `Configure` > `Structure for New Projects` and then `Project Settings` > `Project` > `Project SDK`
   1. If JDK 11 is listed in the drop down, select it. If it is not, click `New...` and select the directory where you installed JDK 11
   1. Click `OK`
1. Import the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open or Import`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. After the importing is complete, locate the `src/main/java/com.jacob.Duke.Duke.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run com.jacob.Duke.Duke.main()`. If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below:
