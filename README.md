# Dukenizer Individual Project

Dukenizer is a desktop app for managing your tasks and taking notes on a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Dukenizer can neatly organize your tasks and notes faster than traditional GUI apps.

For the detailed documentation of this project, see the [Dukenizer Product Website](https://codychew.github.io/ip/).

2. Download the latest `duke.jar` from [here](https://github.com/CodyChew/ip/releases/download/A-Release/duke.jar).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Dukenizer.

4. Double-click the file to start the app, or run `java -jar <folder path>\duke.jar` in your terminal.
