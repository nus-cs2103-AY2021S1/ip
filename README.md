# Bob, the personal assistant

This project was created using Java Object Oriented Programming from a greenfield Java projects project template for a software engineering module (CS2103T) 
at the National University of Singapore. 

It is named Bob, the personal assistant, and functions primarily to track pending tasks of the user. 

Users may interact with Bob by providing commands via a Command Line Interface (CLI) or a simple chat box Graphical User Interface (GUI).
