# User Guide for Project Bill

This is a desktop application that is designed for users to keep track
of the various tasks they want to do. It is under the assumption that 
Users prefer typing to speaking. Thus, this application does not support
voice command. User can use the various functions, such as "add" or "delete"
to help them keep track of their daily tasks. This application is optimized for use via Command Line Interface(CLI) and have
a beautiful Graphical User Interface(GUI). 

This project is modified and built from [Project Duke](https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/projectDuke/index.html)
and it is a very useful educational project designed to help fresh software
developer to horn their skills by slowing building the project and explore
