# Clippy Project
Clippy is a desktop app made by Wang Jun Hao under the module CS2103T AY20/21-S1. Clippy assists you in 
managing your tasks, and it is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). You can keep track of 
your day-to-day tasks, search for specific tasks by keywords and update details of tasks. If you can type fast, Clippy 
can help you keep track of your tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.
